# Substitute Algorithm


## Resources

- [Substitute Algorithm](https://memberservices.informit.com/my_account/webedition/9780135425664/html/substitutealgorithm.html)


---
## Motivation

### To do something efficiently, replace the complicated way with the clearer way

### Remove the whole algorithm and replace it with something simpler

### Substitute Algorithm occurs when learning more about the problem 
- realize that there is just an easier way to do it

### Substitute Algorithm also happens if starting using a library 
- The library supplies features that duplicate the code

---
## Mechanics

- ### Arrange the code to be replaced so that it fills a complete function
- ### Prepare tests using this function only, to capture its behavior
- ### Prepare the alternative algorithm
- ### Run static checks
- ### Run tests to compare the output of the old algorithm to the new one
  - If they are the same, you're done
  - Otherwise, use the old algorithm for comparison in testing and debugging
