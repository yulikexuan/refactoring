## Motivation

### When Running Into Code that's Dealing With Two Different Things 
- Should start to Look For A Way to Split It Into Separate Modules
- To REDUCE Complexity 

### Dividing the Behavior Into Two Sequential Phases is One of the Neatest Ways

### How to Do It?

#### Take the Logic You Need To Do and Break It Down Into Sequential Steps 
- where Each Step is Significantly Different in what it does 

### Carrying Out the Basic Split-Phase Refactoring on Any Fragment of Code 
- Whenever Seeing an Opportunity to Usefully Separate The Code Into Different Phases 

### The Best Clue IS 
- Different Stages of the Fragment Use Different Sets Of Data and Functions 
- Turn them Into Separate Modules to Make This Difference Explicit 
  - in order to reveal the difference in the code
