## Motivation

### Data Structures Play a Particularly Important Role in Understanding

### Data Structures are the Key to Understanding What's Going On
- It is Essential to Keep Them Clear 

> Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified 

> Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowcharts

### The Understanding of Data Improves the More Devs Work on the Software 
- So it is Vital that this Improved Understanding is Embedded Into the Program

### Devs May Want to Rename a Field in a Record Structure 
- but the Idea also Applies to Classes

### Renaming Getters and Setters is just as Important as with Bare Record Structures
- Because Getter and Setter Methods Form an Effective Field for Users of the Class

## Mechanics

- ### If the Record has Limited Scope 
  - Rename all Accesses to the Field and TTest
