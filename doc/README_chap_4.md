# Chapter 4 - Building Tests


## Add the tests immediately after writing a bit of function


## Refactoring requires tests 


## Always make sure a test will fail when it should


## Make sure every test fail at least once


## Run tests frequently

- ### Run tests at least every few minutes on what you are working on
- ### Run all tests at least daily


## Look at all the things the class should do 

- ### Test each one of them for any conditions that might cause the class to fail
- ### Test the areas about going wrong 


## Probing the Boundaries

- ### Concentrate tests where the boundary conditions might go wrong 

- ### Always test behaviours when collections are empty

> Probing: examining somebody/something closely


## Actively thinking about how you can break it 


## Concentrate on where the risk is


## Look at the code and see where it becomes complex 


## Look at a function and consider the likely areas of error


## Start by writing a unit test that exposes the reported bug 


## Self-testing code is to get confidence
